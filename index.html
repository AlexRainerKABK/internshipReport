            I think it gave me a strong insight into how a one-person studio
            operates and how stressful it can become with sudden assignments and
            last-minute changes that still need to meet the deadline. I also
            wasn’t expecting how much he trusted us and treated us as full
            employees, fully involved in every step of each project and even
            making some decisions ourselves. On the other hand, we worked more
            hours than we had agreed, which we accepted, but we didn’t always
            feel that extra effort was appreciated. It also showed me how I
            don’t want to work: he seemed very stressed and often overwhelmed,
            and the workload spilled into his free time. That’s not something I
            want to sacrifice, and I don’t think it’s sustainable. I’ll still
            take some things with me, like how he set up his studio at home.
            It’s convenient, but it also blurs the line between home and work,
            making it hard to switch off mentally. I also reflected on the use
            of AI for coding and was surprised by what you can achieve without
            deep coding knowledge. You can create digital tools tailored to your
            practice or your clients. But you’re still limited by your own
            understanding: if the code becomes too complex and you don’t know
            what to ask the AI, you can’t pinpoint issues, and it may start to
            hallucinate. AI is only as good as the questions you ask it, and
            it’s easy to get carried away by quick results without a clear
            intention.

            <span class="underline_text">Studio Studio Link Tree:</span> This
            was my first and very short assignment after arriving in Gent. A
            website that displayed all his social links on a visible dynamic
            greed that changes on page refresh its dimensions.

          <p id="assignment2" class="content-paragraph" style="display: none">
            <span class="underline_text">3Sec Graphic:</span> This was an
            assignment where Studio Studio was asked to participate at the 3sec
            Gallery. Since the deadline was very short and the assignment was to
            create 60 posters we decided to create a tool that can help us to
            design the posters. We collectively brainstormed on the
            functionality and restrictions on the tool that aligned with the
            concept of Slow and Fast or Close and Far, which arrived from the
            location of the 3sec Gallery. I’m enthusiastic about coding but it
            was also quite challenging for me because of the short deadline we
            had. But in the end I was really surprised on how well it worked to
            code this tool with the help of AI. The tool allows you to control
            layout, scale, spacing, rhythm, density, and canvas size while
            remaining cohesive. And it’s also available for the public to use.

            >
            For this assignment I created a Web shop for the Typo Typo foundry.
            First I created a research report on how other type foundries
            display their typefaces and from there we decided on a design
            concept arriving from the name Typo Typo to create a split panel
            view. Where you have a left panel with all the visual information
            and on the right the more technical details. And so the entire
            navigation and flow of the website works with this split panel view.
